    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      <strong>RianTuber</strong> (com.riantuber.app)<br>
      Effective Date: February 12, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Last Updated: February 12, 2026
    </p>
  </header>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p>RianTuber ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your information when you use the RianTuber iOS application (the "App"). By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this policy. We do <strong>not</strong> operate backend servers that store your personal data or videos.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect and process the following categories of information to provide and improve the App's functionality:</p>

  <h3>1.1 Google Account Information</h3>
  <p>When you sign in using Google OAuth 2.0, we receive limited profile information from Google, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Google account display name</li>
    <li>Your Google account email address</li>
    <li>Your Google account profile photo URL</li>
    <li>An OAuth 2.0 access token and refresh token for YouTube API access</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your Google account password. Authentication is handled entirely by Google's secure OAuth 2.0 framework.</p>

  <h3>1.2 YouTube Channel Data</h3>
  <p>With your authorization, the App accesses the following YouTube channel information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Channel name, ID, and profile image</li>
    <li>Playlist names and IDs</li>
    <li>Upload status and video processing state</li>
    <li>Channel upload limits and quota information</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Video Metadata</h3>
  <p>When you prepare videos for upload, the App processes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Video titles, descriptions, and tags you provide</li>
    <li>Privacy settings (public, unlisted, or private)</li>
    <li>Category selections and playlist assignments</li>
    <li>Scheduled publish dates, if applicable</li>
    <li>Thumbnail images you select or generate</li>
    <li>Optional coarse location (such as city/state) derived from selected video metadata for naming rules, when available</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.4 Device Information</h3>
  <p>We may automatically collect limited device information, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
    <li>App version number</li>
    <li>Device language and region settings</li>
    <li>General device storage availability (to ensure sufficient space for upload operations)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.5 Diagnostics and Logging</h3>
  <p>RianTuber currently does not use third-party analytics SDKs or ad tracking SDKs. The App may generate local diagnostic logs on your device (for example, upload errors) to support core functionality and troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>If cloud crash reporting or analytics are added in a future version, this policy and App Store privacy disclosures will be updated before release.</p>

  <h3>1.6 Photos Library Access</h3>
  <p>With your explicit permission, RianTuber accesses videos you select from your device's Photos library. The App only reads the specific videos you choose for upload — it does not scan, index, or catalog your entire photo library. When available, related metadata (such as creation time and photo location) may be read to support naming and organization features.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>All information collected by RianTuber is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticating your identity via Google Sign-In to access YouTube upload functionality</li>
    <li>Uploading videos you select directly to your YouTube channel via the YouTube Data API</li>
    <li>Displaying your channel information, playlists, and upload history within the App</li>
    <li>Saving your preferences and upload configurations locally for convenience</li>
    <li>Providing upload progress tracking and status notifications</li>
    <li>Diagnosing and resolving technical issues and improving App stability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for advertising, marketing profiling, data brokering, or any purpose unrelated to the App's core video upload functionality.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
  <p>RianTuber stores all user data locally on your device. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OAuth Tokens:</strong> Managed by the Google Sign-In SDK and stored securely in the iOS Keychain, which provides hardware-backed encryption on supported devices.</li>
    <li><strong>App Settings and Preferences:</strong> Stored in the App's sandboxed container using iOS data protection, which encrypts data at rest.</li>
    <li><strong>Upload History and Cache:</strong> Stored locally within the App's sandboxed storage, protected by iOS file-level encryption.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 No Server-Side Storage</h3>
  <p>RianTuber does <strong>not</strong> transmit or store your personal data, videos, OAuth tokens, or account credentials on any external server operated by us. All video uploads occur directly from your device to YouTube's servers using secure HTTPS connections. We do not operate any backend infrastructure that processes or retains user data.</p>
  <p>Some third-party platform requests may still occur as part of app functionality, such as Google/YouTube API calls you authorize and Apple geocoding requests when location-based naming is used.</p>

  <h3>3.3 Security Measures</h3>
  <p>We implement the following security measures to protect your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All network communications use TLS/HTTPS encryption</li>
    <li>OAuth tokens are stored in the iOS Keychain with appropriate access control flags</li>
    <li>The App operates within iOS's application sandbox, preventing unauthorized access from other apps</li>
    <li>We follow Apple's recommended security practices for data protection and secure coding</li>
    <li>We do not log or persist sensitive authentication credentials in plain text</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <h3>4.1 Google and YouTube API Services</h3>
  <p>RianTuber uses the YouTube Data API and Google Sign-In services. Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
  <p>Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We only request the minimum OAuth scopes necessary for the App's functionality</li>
    <li>We do not transfer Google user data to third parties except as necessary to provide the App's features</li>
    <li>We do not use Google user data for advertising or to build user profiles</li>
    <li>We do not allow humans to read Google user data unless required for security purposes, with user consent, or to comply with applicable law</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your use of Google and YouTube services through the App is also subject to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Terms of Service</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Terms of Service</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.2 Apple Services</h3>
  <p>The App may use Apple system services such as Photos framework access and CLGeocoder (for optional location-based naming features). Data handling by these platform services is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <h3>5.1 Retention Period</h3>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, data is retained only for as long as the App is installed and you maintain an active session. We do not retain any user data on remote servers.</p>

  <h3>5.2 Deletion Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Uninstall the App:</strong> Removing RianTuber from your device permanently deletes all locally stored data, including upload history, cached settings, and preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign Out:</strong> Signing out of your Google account within the App clears your OAuth tokens and cached channel data from the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Revoke Google Access:</strong> You can revoke RianTuber's access to your Google account at any time by visiting <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Account Permissions</a> and removing RianTuber from the list of authorized apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Request Deletion:</strong> You may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@riantuber.com">support@riantuber.com</a> to request assistance with data deletion or to confirm that no residual data exists.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request information about what data we process. Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have direct access to it through the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You may delete all App data by uninstalling RianTuber or signing out of your Google account within the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Revoke Consent:</strong> You may revoke RianTuber's access to your Google account at any time via <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Account Permissions</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You may revoke specific permissions (e.g., Photos library access) through iOS Settings → RianTuber.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Since we do not store your data on our servers, there is no server-side data to export. Your videos remain on YouTube under your control and can be managed via <a href="https://studio.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Studio</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your jurisdiction if you believe your data protection rights have been violated.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@riantuber.com">support@riantuber.com</a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>

  <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>RianTuber is a native iOS application and does <strong>not</strong> use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or similar browser-based tracking technologies. The App does not embed any third-party advertising SDKs or tracking frameworks.</p>
  <p>If the App displays web content (e.g., links to YouTube or Google authentication pages), those web pages may use their own cookies and tracking technologies, which are governed by the respective third-party privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>RianTuber is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under 13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not knowingly allow children under 13 to create accounts or use the App</li>
    <li>If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take immediate steps to delete such information</li>
    <li>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@riantuber.com">support@riantuber.com</a> so we can take appropriate action</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>RianTuber is available to users worldwide. When you use the App to upload videos to YouTube, your video data is transmitted directly from your device to Google/YouTube servers, which may be located in various countries around the world. This transfer is initiated by you and is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>Since RianTuber does not operate its own servers or transfer your personal data to our own infrastructure, we do not independently transfer your personal data across international borders. However, by using the App and Google/YouTube services, you acknowledge that your data may be processed in jurisdictions outside your country of residence, including the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make material changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page</li>
    <li>For significant changes, we will provide notice through the App or other appropriate means</li>
    <li>Your continued use of the App after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us:</p>
