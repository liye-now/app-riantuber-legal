  <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the developer resides, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in that jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes not subject to arbitration.</p>

  <h2>13. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving the original intent of the parties.</p>
